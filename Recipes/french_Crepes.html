        <p>Crepes originated from Brittany in the Northwest of France back 
          in the 13th Century. They were so popular that their consumption 
          spread nationwide, leading to the day of "Le Jour des Crepes" which means 
          "The day of the Crepes" a soft, flat piece of cooked batter that can be eaten
          with pretty much any topping you like.

        <p>Crepe Batter</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sift the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl, make a well
              in the center and break the eggs into the middle. With a whisk
              stir whilst keeping to the center until all of the flour has
              gradually absorbed into the eggs. Slowly add approximately two
              thirds of the milk whilst stirring constantly. Stir in the melted butter, 
              Then thin the batter with milk until it has a fresh cream texture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cooking the Crepes</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Lightly butter a pan (it only needs to be buttered once) and heat
            it over a medium-low heat until hot. With one hand lift the pan from
            the flame and with the other hand pour in a ladle of batter. At the
            same time give the pan a rolling motion to rapidly distributing the
            batter evenly across the pan. Return the pan to the heat and leave
            to cook for 30-45 seconds
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Delicately lift the edge of the crepe with a spatula to check
            (after a few times you will have a feeling and everything will go automatically).
            Gently slide spatula underneath the crepe and flip. You can also toss it if you
            prefer. Continue to cook for about 15 seconds then remove from the pan and repeat
            (With the ladle give the batter a quick stir between each crepe).
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>The crepes can be served immediately with your choice of toppings.
